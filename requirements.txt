#Step 7: Create Docker Compose configuration for the project, Docker Compose is the tool that allows us to run our Docker Image easily from our project location, so that it allows us to easily manage the different services (e.g., python, database) that make up our project
#Create a new file called "docker-compose.yml", i.e., the docker compose configuration file, that contains the configuration for all the services that make up our project, i.e., where the Docker Compose will be located
